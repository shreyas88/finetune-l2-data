"Most of your books have an Ars Arcanum at the end, but Tress didn't. Was this a deliberate choice to leave the magic/aethers more open-ended for the future? Or to fit with the fairy tale style?",,"I kind of want Tress to be a little bit of an in-world artifact. This is Hoid telling this story, and it's supposed to feel like the story that he told to some people that got recorded and written down and published for you. And Khriss (who writes the Ars Arcanums) is not involved in that. And it didn't feel appropriate for any of the Secret Projects to do that. So we replaced that with, kind of, my author's discussion of where the book came from, and things like that.","<s>[INST] Most of your books have an Ars Arcanum at the end, but Tress didn't.

"Who is Hoid, as the narrator, telling the story [Tress] to?",,"That is a RAFO in that I believe it is evident in the books. Well... I believe some of it is evident. Not the specific individuals, but this far enough in the future of the Cosmere that I don't want to talk about individuals he might be speaking to. You can figure out the general tone; and people have. It was very clear, I think, to fans when they started posting. So you can ask on a fan forum, if you want them to give their thoughts; but I'm not gonna speak more than that.","<s>[INST] Who is Hoid, as the narrator, telling the story [Tress] to?

"What are the other six types of spores we didn't get to see in the book? Were there any that you really wanted to include, but couldn't?",,"No. When I've written books, I tend to gravitate toward a couple of the aethers that are really the most dynamic for action scenes and things like that. Some of the other aethers are there for the necessity of the future of the Cosmere. For instance: zephyr, while very useful in this for firing cannons and stuff, is really there so that we can have propellant in space by just-add-water and make yourself some extra propellant. And atmosphere; kind of a low-tech (there's better-tech ways), but a low-tech way to: ""hey, we've got zephyr aether, it makes breathable air. And so, if we've got water and a barrel of this stuff, then we'll be able to breathe."" So there are some of the aethers that are there for that sort of reason, so that we can have pneumatic weaponry and some easy access to emergency propellant in space, and stuff like that.","<s>[INST] What are the other six types of spores we didn't get to see in the book?

"If the moons are constantly pouring out spores, how do the oceans not fill up? Do they degrade eventually, or is there another method?",,"Yes, they degrade eventually. I'll be perfectly frank with you: my science on this, I have not gone to all of my normal science routes. The only one of the Secret Projects that we did a lot of the scientific work on is Four, because of how tied into the rest of the Cosmere it is. I have some sort of plausible wiggle room on Book One, because Hoid is telling the story, and he can get some things wrong.","<s>[INST] If the moons are constantly pouring out spores, how do the oceans not fill up?

Is there any chance we could get a map for this world [Lumar] at some point?,,"That's a good idea. We maybe should have done that. The issue is, running that through continuity... We should do it someday. But it's gonna take a little extra work just to make sure on the continuity on that one.

What does the Cognitive Realm of Lumar look like?,,"I'm gonna RAFO that for now. I've been playing a little bit with the Cognitive Realm on some of these planets, so I will RAFO it for now.
